            This book is rewarding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hill paints the world that we currently live in with monochrome colours. However, I didn't find his pessimistic descriptions of everyday life disheartening, for they were full of hidden truths. These descriptions were refreshing to read since they tended be thought provoking rather than cliche.

            Unfortunately, the first half of the book was very slow going. I found I could not relate or find inspiration in the characters who all seemed sad, lonely and unambitious. It was only towards the end half of the book that I began to realise how crucial every little detail of these lives were. I started to go 'ah!' when I realised an obscure link, and began trying to guess where Hill was taking the story next. This is the point that I really started to enjoy the book and realised how rewarding it was.

            Whilst I would love to give this book a bit more than three stars, I think a four or five star book should have the reader from a lot earlier on. I would only recommend this book to regular and persistent readers.
