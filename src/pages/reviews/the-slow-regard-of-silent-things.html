            "Without her halo of hair, Auri felt small. Not the smallness that she strove for every day. Not the smallness of a tree among trees. Of a shadow underground."

          <p>
            The Slow Regard of Silent Things can be described as a fantastical personification of OCD. Auri herself displays no more than a few personality traits, making it difficult to remain engaged when reading about reorganising shelves and making soap. Sentence after sentence of moving and rearranging objects failed to mesmerise me, instead boring me and leading me to wonder if anything interesting would happen.

          <p>
            So this story isn't for me, and it seems that there are enough people who like it to verify that this story is indeed for other people. I appreciate the honesty of Rothfuss for acknowledging that the story breaks too many rules. I also respect that he wrote and published something that he urgently needed to write. Nevertheless, I'm keeping my habit of reviewing up, and I've been honest here.
